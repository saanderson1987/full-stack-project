What gives you hope during tough times?

I have faced some very tough times. When I was 10 years old, my twin sister and I were used in medical experiments by Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz. He injected me with a deadly germ and a few days later he came to the sick barrack where I was sent. He never even examined me. He looked at my fever chart and declared, laughing sarcastically, "Too bad, she's so young - she has only two weeks to live." At that time I knew he was right - I was very ill. But I refused to die. I made a silent pledge: That I will prove Mengele wrong, that I will survive, and I will be reunited with Miriam.

For the next two weeks I was between life and death. I have only one memory - crawling on the barrack floor, because I no longer could walk. There was a faucet on the other end of the barrack. As I was crawling, I would fade in and out of consciousness. I just kept thinking, I must survive, I must survive. After two weeks, my fever broke and I immediately felt a lot stronger. It took me another 3 weeks before my fever chart showed normal and I was released from the barrack of the living dead and reunited with my twin sister Miriam. That event - surviving whatever I was injected with - serves to me as a very big source of strength.

When my son had cancer, I couldn't get him to accept the fact that he had to fight for his life, that he had to make the choice to fight for his life. No one else could do it for him. I repeated to him the story of my survival in Auschwitz. He got mad at me and I just said, "Alex, when I was in Auschwitz, the doctors who were around me wanted me dead. I made the decision that I would live. Can you make that decision?" He got mad at me and hung up the phone - he wasn't ready to deal with it. But he called me back two days later. Alex said, "Mom, I think I understand it. This is my Auschwitz. This is my struggle that I need to survive." If the person who is suffering from cancer doesn't even want to make the decision to live, no one can help them. My son is alive today.

The fact that I have overcome so much adversity in my life helps me to have hope during tough times. I believe if I could survive Auschwitz, if I could survive crawling on the barrack floor between life and death, I could probably survive anything. Basically that is the way we gain confidence in our ability. When we overcome one difficulty and one hardship, we can build on that when any other hardship comes along in life. I also like the fact that people who hear me speak  can tune in and feel inspired. They see that I could do it, and they realize they can overcome whatever they are trying to overcome too. That is helpful to realize, that maybe each of us can help others overcome by sharing our stories.

You can also look for ideas on YouTube and the Internet for people who have overcome tough times. You will find a story that fits your situation. Then when you are inspired, DO something. Make a commitment to yourself. Make a promise and keep it close by. If you get off track, don’t feel guilty - we all do it. Just get right back on it.

Some children hVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CAPS LOCK KEY.
Some children EMPHASIZE a LOT of their WORDS.
Some Children are accustomed to the Germanic forms of Capitalization.
So many options: examples would help.

It may mean multiple things:

She is communicating with aliens in a secret language and she does not want you to understand the code for security purposes.  In this case, I recommend you do not interfere.
She wants to get into MIT when she grows up and she is practicing a code in some computer programming language you do not yet understand.  In this case, you encourage her and also, try to learn the language yourself.
She is trying to write English, in which case you need to tell her to stop doing this immediately.  The English language usually does not recommend camel casing in regular sentences.  She needs to know that WriTing LiKe ThIs isn't cool even if her friends in school do think so.

My 8-year-old child purposely drowned a cat and watched her die. He didn't show any signs of remorse. What should I do?

Psychiatric professionals stat. The people who say he was probably just curious are outrageously wrong. Eight is old enough to know it's wrong to drown a cat just to watch it die. Stepping on ants on purpose might be normal at that age. Hitting a cat if you're two or if you're an eight-year-old who the cat just bit is normal. Hunting can have a purpose. But what he did is pathological.

If he has something severely wrong internally, a skillful psychiatric professional can help you as his parent and help him as a person. Maybe he has some sort of lack in the empathy department that could be moderated with early intervention. Or maybe he has some illness presenting earlier than normal, one that leads to psychosis. Or perhaps some sort of developmental delay that will apparently be dangerous if not handled.

If he is doing this to act out on the basis of cruelty he has witnessed or been subjected to by others, a skillful psychiatric professional can also help with that.

I would not recommend expressing rage or misery about the issue; he doesn't sound like someone who would be moved by either reaction right now. After all, he just inflicted great misery on an animal and didn't mind it at all.

This behavior is not normal. It is pathological. He needs help, and if you don't get it for him you will be negligent.

I do know someone who hurt animals when he was younger and is a good person now — he was being abused and took it out on animals. On the other hand, he always felt guilty. And he did get help.

We can't really know the full extent of what is happening with your son and why.

With that said, good on you for asking for advice. You care. I would, to be completely frank, be horrified to find myself in your situation. Whatever happens, whether good or bad, will not be easy. So keep looking for support for yourself while you help your son. I wish both of you the best.



What are some unique, effective ways to discipline a child?

When I was in 7th grade, I started swearing.  A lot.  Instead of washing my mouth out with soap or grounding me, my ever-creative mother asked "Aaron, do you want us to become a swearing family?"

"Sure, they're just words," I retorted in what I'm sure was an annoying smart-guy voice.

"Fine," my prim, proper and kindly mom said in a gentle voice. "Now get your f***ing a** back to your room and do your f***ing homework you f***ing son of a b***h."

I was so horrified that I did not swear again at home until I left for college.  My mom didn't either.
